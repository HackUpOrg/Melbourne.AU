##What is this?
A 100% *Hands On* lab where you sit down and work on a side project and/or experiment with new tech.

It's about getting stuff done.

##But .. this is just a hackathon?
[No](http://upboat.me/gc/-/no.jpg). This is different because it's just 2 hours of tappy-tap-tap/twiddle-twiddle-twiddle. Not an entire day or weekend - [parents don't have time for that](http://i.imgur.com/M7K3Tis.gif).

##What is this not!
You typical meetup where you rock up, listen to a speaker and then eat some unhealthy food.

##Skills required
*Anything*. We're code/hardware agnostic.

##Next Lab
- Lab.1 [Thursday 13th November](https://github.com/HackUpOrg/Melbourne.AU/issues/1) - 6pm to 8:00/8:30pm.

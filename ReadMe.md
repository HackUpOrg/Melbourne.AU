##What is this?
A 100% *Hands On* lab where you sit down and work on a side project and/or experiment with new tech - **_for a few hours only._**

It's about getting stuff done.

##But .. this is just a hackathon?
[No](http://upboat.me/gc/-/no.jpg). This is different because it's just 2 to 3 hours of tappy-tap-tap/twiddle-twiddle-twiddle. Not an entire day or weekend - [some people just don't have time for that](http://i.imgur.com/M7K3Tis.gif).

##What is this not!
You typical meetup where you rock up, listen to a speaker and then eat some unhealthy food.

##Skills required
*Anything*. We're code/hardware agnostic.
